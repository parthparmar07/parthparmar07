Key Findings:
=============
1. The Random Forest achieved the best performance with R² = 0.9898
2. Present price is the strongest predictor of selling price
3. Car age and depreciation rate are crucial factors in price determination
4. Model can predict car prices with average error of Rs.0.27 lakhs

Business Implications:
======================
1. Age Depreciation: Cars depreciate significantly with age, following predictable patterns
2. Brand Value: Some brands maintain value better than others
3. Mileage Impact: High mileage vehicles show greater depreciation
4. Market Trends: The model can help in fair price estimation for buyers and sellers

Recommendations:
================
1. Use the Random Forest for production price predictions
2. Regularly retrain the model with new market data
3. Consider additional features like service history, accident records
4. Implement confidence intervals for price predictions
